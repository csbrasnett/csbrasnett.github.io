	<p> I'm a PhD student in the School of Physics at the University of Bristol, where I research the mesophase 
    	behaviour of model lipid systems using both experimental and computational techniques. 
	</p>
	
	<p> I am an experienced user of X-ray scattering (SAXS) techniques, having been 
    	awarded several synchrotron beamtime proposals during my PhD, alongside extensively using a lab-based instrument.
	</p>
	
	<p> I run molecular dynamics simulations using GROMACS and the coarse-grained <a href="http://cgmartini.nl/">Martini</a> force field.
    	I write my own analysis scripts using Python, which can be found in <a href="https://github.com/csbrasnett/lipid-md">this GitHub 
    	repository</a>.
	</p>
	
	<p> I also maintain a keen interest in research policy and environment, having spent a sabbatical year from my PhD
    	working in the area as a students' union postgraduate education officer.
